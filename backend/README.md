## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dipeshkumarsah98/Blogging-Platform.git
```

### Install Dependencies

Navigate to your project directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### Environment Setup

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the necessary environment variables:

```bash

```

## Database Modeling, Migration, and Seeding with Prisma

### Setup

- Ensure your database connection details are correctly set up in `prisma/schema.prisma`.
- Install the Prisma CLI if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install @prisma/cli --save-dev
```

### Migration

Create and apply migrations to update your database schema:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

### Seeding

Populate your database with initial data using the seed script defined in `prisma/seed.js`:

```bash
npx prisma db seed
```

### Visualizing Database Model

- Generate a DBML file using Prisma and save it in the Prisma directory (It will be generated automatically when you run `npx prisma generate`).
- Visit [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io) and paste the contents of your DBML file to visualize your database schema.

```bash
npx prisma-docs-generator serve
```

This command starts a local server where you can view detailed documentation of your Prisma models.
